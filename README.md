# Objetivo
The objective of a body density program is to calculate the relationship between body mass and body volume, useful for assessing health and performance.


# Background
## Que es el front?
The frontend is the part of a software system that interacts directly with the user. It is responsible for displaying the graphical interface and collecting user input, such as forms and mouse clicks, and then sending this information to the backend for processing. It is also responsible for presenting the results or responses from the backend in a way that is understandable and appealing to the user. In short, the frontend focuses on the user experience and the visual representation of the application or website.

# Overview
